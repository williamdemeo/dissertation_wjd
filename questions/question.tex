Suppose the group $G$ acts in the usual way on the cosets of a *core-free* subgroup $H< G$, and suppose the index of $H$ is $|G:H|=n$.  Let $S$ be a finite non-abelian simple group and consider $G$ acting on $S^n$ by permuting the coordinates, just as $G$ permutes the cosets $G/H$.  Let $\phi: G \rightarrow Aut(S^n)$ denote this action.  This results in the semidirect product

$$ W = S^n \rtimes_\phi G$$

Now let $D = \{(s,s,\dots, s) \mid s\in S\}$ be the diagonal subgroup of $S^n$.  Then I believe the interval above $D\rtimes_\phi G$ in the subgroup lattice of $W$ will be dually isomorphic to the interval above $H$ in the subgroup lattice of $G$  (cf. [Kurzweil 1985](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=779379)).

**Question:** Is the subgroup $D\rtimes_\phi G$ core-free in $W$?

One thing seems clear: $D\rtimes_\phi G = D\times G$, since the action of permuting coordinates does not effect the elements of the diagonal.  So, in fact, $D\times 1$ is centralized by $1\times G$.
